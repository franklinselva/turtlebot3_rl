# turtlebot3_rl

This repository contains the implementation for mobile robot navigation using RL algorithms. The planned algorithms to be tested are Q-learning, SARSA and extended-SARSA. The work contains a total of 6 categories: implementation of above original algorithm with HITL. The environments are tested with static obstacle but should be fine with dynamic obstacles.

## INSTALLATION

We will need the turtlebot3 and turtlebot3_simulation packages for these to work. Installation procedure are presented in their respective github pages.

## PROCEDURE
